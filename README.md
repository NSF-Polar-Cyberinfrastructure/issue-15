Polar Data Analytics as a Service (PDAaaS)

The goal of this workshop is for us to 

 * gather a comprehensive list of useful software components which can be used to lower the barrier for interaction with Polar datasetsq
 * based upon the above, create a [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) image which includes all of this software meaning that no installation is required on the users part
 * make an effort towards documenting data resources. This is driven by the reqirement for the US Coast Guard Academy to to locate and retrieve information for a variety of use cases.
